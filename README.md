# Ravnica Task Force Tools

A suite of lightweight, offline-first HTML tools for 5th Edition tabletop roleplaying games. Zero dependencies—just open the files in your browser.

Campaign management apps (Tools Hub, Campaign Hub, Case Board, Player Dashboard, NPC Roster, Locations DB, Requisition Vault, Mission Timeline, Ledger, Encounter Recipes, HQ Foundry) share a unified Local Storage object (`RTF_STORE`). Import/export once from the Tools Hub and those pages stay in lockstep. Lead Queue and both clock pages use dedicated local-storage keys; Lead Queue and Prep/Procedure still integrate with case context and timeline/board links.

Optional Supabase cloud sync is available for the shared `RTF_STORE` stack. See **[Supabase Sync Setup](docs/SupabaseSync.md)**.

## Components

Each tool runs offline. The campaign stack (Hub, Board, Dashboard, Roster, Locations, Requisitions, Timeline, Ledger, Encounters, HQ) shares the `RTF_STORE` object. Lead Queue, Prep/Procedure, and Clocks keep page-owned state keys; Lead Queue and Prep/Procedure cross-link into the campaign stack while Clocks remains standalone.

## Usage
Open any `.html` file in a modern browser (Edge, Chrome, Firefox). Data writes to Local Storage automatically. Import/export JSON via Tools Hub for the shared campaign stack, and use page-specific import/export controls where available (for example Character Sheet, Session Tracker, HQ Foundry, Campaign Hub).

To enable multi-device player/DM sync on GitHub Pages deployments, configure Supabase from the Tools Hub panel after following **[Supabase Sync Setup](docs/SupabaseSync.md)**.
For simpler player onboarding, share/import a `connect.json` profile (also documented in **[Supabase Sync Setup](docs/SupabaseSync.md)**).
